Ritmo: Rhythm-Game
===
Two colleagues and I created a custom rhythm video game in which the player must match notes that scroll on-screen to the buttons on the keyboard in rhythmic synchronization to the ongoing music. The game plays similarly to the world renown rhythm game, Guitar Hero. The game features various levels of difficulty and several songs, each with different gameplay. 

How to Play

Run the Game.java class

Playing requires nothing more than a sense of the rhythm, a small degree of patience, and dexterity.

Controls: Q W E R buttons for the 4 note-lanes


In the Works

We are working on implementing a streamlined user interface to introduce an open-source design in which players can import their own songs and level designs into the game.
