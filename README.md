Ritmo: Rhythm-Game
===
Two colleagues and I created a custom rhythm video game in which the player must match notes that scroll on-screen to the buttons on the keyboard in rhythmic synchronization to the ongoing music. The game features various levels of difficulty and several songs, each with different gameplay. 

How to Play
---
Run the Game.java class

Controls: Q W E R for the 4 note-lanes


In the Works

We are working on implementing an open-source design in which players can import their own songs and level designs into the game.
