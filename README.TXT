PROJECT TITLE: Ritmo_Rhythm-Game
AUTHORS: Justin Lee, Daniel Tao, Malachi Tzuoo
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: A colleague and I created a custom rhythm video game in which the player must match notes that scroll on-screen to the buttons on the keyboard in rhythmic synchronization to the ongoing music. The game features various levels of difficulty and several songs, each with different gameplay. The game also features an open-source design in which players can import their own songs and level designs.
